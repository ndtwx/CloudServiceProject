Project Description:

Online E-Commerce System On Cloud Infrastructure 

An E-Commerce that acts as a central database containing stock and inventory. This project is a website that acts as a central e-commerce store. This web project is developed using a web tool as the front end and SQL (Database) as the back end. E-commerce tends to get a large amount of online visitors. The system must be hosted on a cloud infrastructure to provide optimal performance and avoid site crashes. 

The SQL database stores product details. A website user can see various products arranged in respective categories. The user may purchase a product and view its price.

The organization has plans to expand to markets overseas.
